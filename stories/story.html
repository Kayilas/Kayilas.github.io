            <h2>Chapter 1: A Private’s War</h2>
			<p>The forest was deathly quiet.</p>

<p>Snow crunched beneath heavy boots, and breath misted in the frozen air, but no one spoke. The squad moved carefully, rifles raised, eyes scanning for movement between the trees. Somewhere ahead, hidden beyond the thick woods, lay their objective—the Entente Alliance’s supply facility. Their orders were simple: recon the area and report back. Engagement was to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Tanya Degurechaff, Private, gripped her rifle tighter and exhaled slowly.</p>

<p>"This is idiotic," she thought. "Half the squad’s fresh out of accelerated training, our leader’s too eager for action, and Command clearly has no idea what they’re doing."</p>

<p>Sergeant Richer, their commanding officer, crouched near a fallen log and raised a fist, signaling the squad to halt. “Eyes sharp. We’re close,” he whispered. “Two scouts, forward.”</p>

<p>Tanya watched as two soldiers crept ahead, moving like ghosts through the underbrush. The plan was simple: they’d confirm enemy presence, report back, and—</p>

<p>A gunshot shattered the silence.</p>

<p>Then another.</p>

<p>The scouts didn’t return.</p>

<p>“Shit!” someone cursed. A split-second later, a hail of bullets tore through the trees.</p>

<p>The squad scattered, diving for cover as enemy fire rained down. Tanya flattened herself behind a thick oak, heart hammering against her ribs.</p>

<p>"Ambush!" Richer shouted. "Return fire!"</p>

<p>Bullets zipped past. Someone screamed. Tanya forced herself to stay calm, peeking out just enough to fire a shot. An Entente soldier dropped, but more swarmed forward. This wasn’t just a random patrol—this was a kill squad.</p>

<p>Then, it happened.</p>

<p>A mage soared above the treetops, glowing with blue energy. His rifle sparked as he aimed downward—</p>

<p>Sergeant Richer’s head snapped back, blood spraying into the snow.</p>

<p>For a moment, the battlefield went still.</p>

<p>Then chaos erupted.</p>

<p>"Sergeant’s down!" someone yelled.</p>

<p>“Shit—what do we do!?”</p>

<p>A panicked voice screamed, “We need orders!”</p>

<p>Orders? Who the hell was going to—</p>

<p>A sharp buzz crackled through Tanya’s radio. “Squad, report!” Command Post.</p>

<p>Tanya’s fingers were ice-cold as she pressed the radio to her mouth. “Sergeant Richer is KIA! We’re pinned down!”</p>

<p>A brief silence. Then: “You’re in command now, Private Degurechaff.”</p>

<p>She nearly dropped the radio.</p>

<p>"I’m what?"</p>

<p>“This is a battlefield, soldier! Your squad needs a leader—now lead!”</p>

<p>The line cut off.</p>

<p>Tanya’s brain stalled.</p>

<p>She was a private. She was not supposed to lead. She was not supposed to be making tactical decisions. This was so far above her damn pay grade—</p>

<p>The sound of gunfire snapped her back to reality. Focus. Think.</p>

<p>The squad was falling apart, and if they stayed here, they’d be wiped out. They needed to move. They needed to fight.</p>

<p>Tanya’s grip on her rifle tightened. “Listen up, you idiots!” she snapped. “If we stay here, we’re dead! Fall back, and follow my lead!”</p>

<p>“Why the hell should we—”</p>

<p>“Because if you don’t, you’re already corpses! MOVE!”</p>

<p>It wasn’t a strategy. It was desperation. But it worked.</p>

<p>The squad broke from cover, retreating into the trees with Tanya at the front. Bullets whizzed past, but the trees provided just enough cover to keep them alive.</p>

<p>They ran.</p>

<p>And then they ran straight into the enemy supply facility.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p>

<p>Tanya’s breath came in sharp gasps as she took in the sight before her.</p>

<p>A storage yard filled with crates. Fuel drums stacked in the open. A perfect weak point.</p>

<p>A wicked grin crept onto her face. "Oh, this will do nicely."</p>

<p>“Set charges on the fuel tanks!” she barked. “We’re blowing this place sky-high!”</p>

<p>No arguments this time. The squad moved fast, setting explosives as Tanya kept an eye on the perimeter. They were on borrowed time.</p>

<p>With a final click, the charges were set. Tanya didn’t hesitate—</p>

<p>“FIRE IN THE HOLE!”</p>

<p>BOOM.</p>

<p>The shockwave sent snow flying as fire roared through the facility. Enemy soldiers scrambled in the chaos, but Tanya wasn’t done yet.</p>

<p>She spotted another structure deeper in the woods—a storage bunker. Guards posted. Probably holding something important.</p>

<p>Her rifle snapped up, targeting the mage on duty.</p>

<p>One shot.</p>

<p>The bullet struck the mage’s flight orb. It crackled—then exploded.</p>

<p>The resulting blast ignited the nearby artillery shells.</p>

<p>Another boom.</p>

<p>Tanya turned to her squad, smirking. “That’s two facilities down. Time to leave before we overstay our welcome.”</p>

<p>They vanished into the forest as Entente reinforcements arrived too late.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h3>Military Command Meeting – Imperial Headquarters<br />
</h3>

<p>The air in the briefing room was tense.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Zettour sat at the head of the table, fingers steepled, listening as the intelligence officer read the latest field reports.</p>

<p>“Casualties were minimal. However, we lost Sergeant Richer early in the operation.”</p>

<p>A murmur spread through the room.</p>

<p>Zettour frowned. “And yet, the mission resulted in the destruction of two major supply facilities?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Zettour nodded. “That makes sense. Richer was an exceptional soldier. It’s only natural he’d—”</p>

<p>“Sir,” the intelligence officer interrupted, voice hesitant. “Sergeant Richer was killed almost immediately. Someone else took over.”</p>

<p>Zettour’s brow furrowed. “Who?”</p>

<p>The officer swallowed. “A member of his squad, sir.”</p>

<p>The room erupted.</p>

<p>“Who the hell—”<br />
“A non-officer led the mission?”<br />
“Who gave them command?”</p>

<p>Zettour slammed his hand on the table. “Enough! Who was it?”</p>

<p>The intelligence officer fumbled with a file, pushing it forward. “Sir, the thing is, she—”</p>

<p>Zettour’s eyes flicked to the name on the report.</p>

<p>Private Tanya Degurechaff.</p>

<p>The silence was deafening.</p>

<p>“She’s not a Sergeant?” he asked, voice dangerously quiet.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>No one spoke.</p>

<p>Then, finally—</p>

<p>“Bring me everything we have on this private.”</p>

<p>─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Orders from Above</h2>

<h4>
  <b>Rhine Front Command - General Staff Office</b>
</h4>

<p>Zettour sat in his office, flipping through the personnel file of the supposed genius behind the Entente Alliance supply depot attack. He had expected a young prodigy from the war academies—someone with an extensive service record or, at the very least, a tactician trained in strategic warfare.</p>

<p>Instead, the file in front of him was... barren.</p>

<p>The first page contained the basics: Name: Tanya Degurechaff. Age: 10. Rank: Private. Zettour frowned. Ten? That couldn't be right. It had to be a clerical mistake. The date of birth must have been recorded incorrectly.</p>

<p>His brow furrowed as he skimmed the page. No advanced schooling. No tactical courses. Not even civilian schooling. Only one year of military training? That alone was suspicious. Either this was an error, or someone was intentionally hiding information.</p>

<p>He turned to the second page, which contained the field report Tanya had submitted regarding the mission. The summary was dry, straightforward, and professional. There was no embellishment or attempt to take credit—just a concise description of the operation.</p>

<p>Zettour moved on to the third page: a preliminary record of Tanya Degurechaff’s operational history. It was sparse, containing only two entries.<b></b></p>

<p>
  <b>Confirmed Achievements:</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>Successful destruction of an enemy supply depot and weapons storage facility.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Operational Mistakes:</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>Tactical miscalculation during initial engagement (resulted in minor strategic inefficiencies).</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Zettour blinked. She’s only been on two missions?!</p>

<p>If he hadn't seen the intelligence report himself, he would have thought this was a joke. He flipped to the last page and nearly dropped the file.</p>

<p>The final page was a photograph. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed child in an Imperial uniform stood at attention.</p>

<p>Zettour exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. This is correct? This is the soldier who just blew up a key Entente weapons facility?</p>

<p>The office remained silent as he processed what he had just learned.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>
  <b>Central Research Division - Doctor Schugel’s Office</b>
</h4>

<p>Doctor Adelheid von Schugel adjusted his glasses, his eyes scanning through lists of potential candidates for his latest experimental project—the A195 Shield. A breakthrough device, one that could change the future of infantry warfare. But he needed the right subject for testing. Someone... durable yet malleable.</p>

<p>As he flipped through the personnel records, one file immediately caught his attention. A small smirk tugged at his lips as he skimmed the details.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Name: Tanya Degurechaff.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Rank: Private</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Age: 10</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>"Yes… she’ll be perfect."</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>
  <b>Entente Front - Tanya’s Tent</b>
</h4>

<p>Tanya sighed, leaning against the cot in her tent at the Entente Front Command. Well, I suppose I should be grateful I’m not in the trenches right now.</p>

<p>Two days had passed since the ridiculous assignment that should have been way above her pay grade. The squad leader had been killed, the command post had panicked, and somehow, somehow, Tanya had been the one to take charge.</p>

<p>She shook her head, smirking. "Hah, maybe this’ll get me a promotion."</p>

<p>At this rate, I’ll be a sergeant before I hit eleven.</p>

<p>The thought was amusing enough that she let out a small chuckle before speaking internally to Being X, taunting the so-called "god" about how well she was doing despite his interference.</p>

<p>Her amusement was short-lived when a representative from the command post stepped into her tent.</p>

<p>"Private Degurechaff," the man said with a hesitant nod.</p>

<p>Tanya put on her most neutral expression. "Sir?"</p>

<p>The officer cleared his throat, looking slightly uncomfortable. "We… apologize for the last mission. The command post was in disarray after Sergeant Richter’s death, and in the panic, we—"</p>

<p>"It was no big deal," Tanya interrupted, maintaining her polite tone while internally cursing them out. 'If you can throw me into a command position mid-battle, why not move me to the damn rear?!'</p>

<p>The representative coughed before handing her a document. "You’ve been issued a new deployment order. The Central Technology Division has requested you for testing."</p>

<p>Tanya blinked, staring at the paper.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Testing?</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Suppressing the urge to smile, she forced herself to read through the document carefully before responding.</p>

<p>"I understand, sir. Thank you for the notice."</p>

<p>The officer visibly flinched, taking an unconscious step back. The look in Tanya’s eyes sent a chill down his spine. How can a child exude such... presence?</p>

<p>He quickly excused himself and left.</p>

<p>Tanya exhaled through her nose, gripping the document. No more freezing frontlines. No more random bullets flying at me. No more idiots playing hero.</p>

<p>She had officially been transferred out of active combat.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4><b>Entente </b> <b>Front - Departure</b></h4>

<p>Tanya stood in front of ‘her’ squad, listening as the soldiers joked around.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>"Man, what are we gonna do without our new commander?" one of them laughed.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>"Yeah, Tanya, don’t forget about us when you’re busy playing with gadgets back in Central!"</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>"Try not to get blown up, alright?"</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Tanya rolled her eyes, waving them off. "Yeah, yeah, I’ll miss you idiots too."</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Despite her casual response, she could feel a strange weight in her chest. Damn, I actually got attached to these fools.</p>

<p>But sentimentality wouldn’t help her survive.</p>

<p>Without looking back, she boarded the train to Central.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>
  <b>On the Train to Central</b>
</h4>

<p>Tanya leaned back in her seat, skimming through the report on her upcoming assignment.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>A195 Shield…</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The document claimed it was a new experimental device to assist infantry in tanking fire. A new type of armor? A riot shield? A reinforced vest?</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Why were they bringing a private from the front to test it?</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Her eyes drifted to a smaller line of text near the bottom.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>"Private Tanya Degurechaff will be retested for magical aptitude upon arrival and before testing."</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>She snorted. "Pfft—HAHAHA! Magic?! These morons seriously think I can develop magic overnight?!"</p>

<p>If she had magic, she wouldn't be stuck in the trenches. She’d be living the easy life as an aerial mage, far away from the mud and blood of the frontlines.</p>

<p>But… what if they expected her to have magic?</p>

<p>Her laughter died down as she furrowed her brows.</p>

<p>Wait. If I don’t have magic, will they just send me back?</p>

<p>She tried to reassure herself. It was probably just a formality. Yeah, that's why it was in a different font. Just a standard test. Nothing to worry about… right?</p>

<p>As she mulled over the implications, she barely noticed the tall, brown-haired officer who had entered the train car.</p>

<p>He spotted Tanya sitting in her seat.</p>

<p>His gaze lingered on her for a moment before he started walking over.</p>

<p>─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Unwanted Attention</h2>

<p>Tanya sat in the train car, arms crossed, staring blankly at the passing scenery. The rhythmic clatter of the rails was a small comfort—steady, predictable. Unlike whatever bureaucratic nonsense awaited her in Central. She had no illusions about the military’s generosity; she was being sent somewhere, and that somewhere likely had strings attached.</p>

<p>As the train rattled on, she caught movement in her peripheral vision. A man, brown-haired, sharp-eyed, dressed in an officer’s uniform. He was watching her.</p>

<p>Tanya suppressed a sigh. Another curious onlooker. She’d gotten plenty of those ever since the battlefield. Too young. Too small. Too competent.</p>

<p>The man approached.</p>

<p>"Interesting uniform for someone your size," he remarked casually, taking the seat across from her. His tone was light, but his gaze was studying her intently.</p>

<p>Tanya forced a polite smile. "Is it? It fits just fine."</p>

<p>He chuckled, leaning back slightly, but not relaxing. "That’s not what I meant. The battlefield isn’t kind to children playing soldier."</p>

<p>Tanya’s smile twitched, but she kept her irritation in check. "Good thing I’m not playing, then."</p>

<p>The officer hummed thoughtfully. "I take it you’ve seen action."</p>

<p>"Something like that."</p>

<p>He tilted his head, as if considering something. "What unit were you with?"</p>

<p>"203rd. Infantry." She kept her answer clipped and controlled, though the last word was barely audible.</p>

<p>"Haven’t heard of them."</p>

<p>"We didn’t have the luxury of making a name for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Hm." He let that sit for a moment. "And where’d you train?"</p>

<p>Tanya shrugged. "Nowhere special."</p>

<p>The man was testing her, she realized. Subtly probing. Seeing if she’d slip up. He still wasn’t sure if she was some child with delusions of grandeur or something else entirely.</p>

<p>Fine. Two could play that game.</p>

<p>"I assume you trained somewhere prestigious," she said, feigning polite curiosity. "Maybe one of the mage academies?"</p>

<p>His eyebrows twitched upward ever so slightly. Got him.</p>

<p>"I did, actually," he admitted, watching for a reaction. "You’ve heard of Kriegsschule, I assume?"</p>

<p>Tanya nodded like it was the most natural thing in the world. "Of course."</p>

<p>In truth, she barely knew anything about it. The name was vaguely familiar—one of the many institutions that trained mages. But she wasn’t about to give him the satisfaction of looking ignorant.</p>

<p>The officer studied her for another long moment. Then, seemingly satisfied, he stood. "Well, whatever the case, I’ll be looking forward to seeing your career develop."</p>

<p>He gave a small smirk before turning to leave.</p>

<p>"Hope to see you in the air sometime."</p>

<p>Tanya froze.</p>

<p>Air?</p>

<p>She replayed the conversation in her head. He thought—no, he assumed—she was a mage. Of course he did. That explained everything.</p>

<p>She barely suppressed a groan. Fantastic. That was going to bite her later.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>
  <b>Central Technology Facility - Train Station</b>
</h4>

<p>When she stepped off the train, Tanya was met with a stark contrast to the mud and blood of the frontlines. The facility before her was sleek, industrial, and intimidatingly clean.</p>

<p>No trenches. No artillery screaming overhead.</p>

<p>For the first time in a while, she felt a small flicker of relief.</p>

<p>A stiff-looking officer was waiting for her, barely sparing her a glance before barking, "Follow me."</p>

<p>Tanya did.</p>

<p>She was led through pristine halls, passing by officers and researchers who didn’t so much as blink at her presence. Unlike the battlefield, where she was either underestimated or gawked at, here she was just another asset. A tool being shuffled from one place to another.</p>

<p>The first stop was a check-up.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Height. Weight. Reflexes. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Cold.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Methodical.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She was treated like a specimen more than a person. She briefly considered mouthing off, but she knew better than to antagonize bureaucrats needlessly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Then came the magic aptitude test.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p>

<p>A stone tablet. A single touch was all it took.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The result?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>G.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Not F. Worse.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>F was unsuitable, but G was something else entirely. A magic aptitude so bad that even standing too close to an activated computation orb could cause interference with it.</p>

<p>Tanya expected it. But seeing the test proctors exchange baffled, disgusted looks still irked her.</p>

<p>A few of them muttered amongst themselves.</p>

<p>"Is this really what Schugel wanted?"</p>

<p>"Unbelievable. A waste of testing materials."</p>

<p>Some shot her barely concealed glares. She wasn’t just an unsuitable test subject—she was an insult.</p>

<p>Then, the doors burst open.</p>

<p>"Perfect!"</p>

<p>The man who entered was tall, wild-eyed, and carrying the unmistakable air of a lunatic.</p>

<p>Tanya barely had time to react before he grabbed her wrist.</p>

<p>"Ah—what—?"</p>

<p>The test proctors snapped to attention. "Doctor Schugel—are you sure—"</p>

<p>Schugel.</p>

<p>Realization clicked in Tanya’s head. This was the damn scientist who wanted her?!</p>

<p>Schugel ignored the protests and dragged her along the hall.</p>

<p>"Wait a second—!" Tanya twisted slightly, trying to get a look at him. "What the hell is this about?"</p>

<p>"No magic, but you performed that well in battle? Now that’s interesting!"</p>

<p>Oh. He was insane.</p>

<p>Tanya let out a slow breath. No point arguing with a madman.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>
  <b>Central Technology Facility - Prototype Room</b>
</h4>

<p>Schugel pulled her into another room.</p>

<p>There, on a pedestal, sat what looked like a sleek, experimental computation orb.</p>

<p>She looked at the name labelled below it: Type 95 Computation Orb?</p>

<p>Schugel finally let go of her, rushing off to finish whatever paperwork was needed to secure her as a test subject.</p>

<p>Tanya, finally free, turned to the other staff. "What exactly is the A195?"</p>

<p>The researchers exchanged looks, surprised by her directness, before seemingly deciding she was important enough to answer.</p>

<p>One of them—a younger woman—picked up an old military shield. "You’re familiar with these, right? The A195 is like a combination of this and a mage’s orb."</p>

<p>Tanya narrowed her eyes. "Explain."</p>

<p>The woman perked up, clearly eager. "It allows the user to create an energy barrier in front of their hand, one that can be moved and directed! Theoretically, it should be able to withstand—"</p>

<p>She launched into a long-winded explanation. Tanya tuned out the excitement, focusing instead on what wasn’t being said.</p>

<p>Why test this on her?</p>

<p>Why assign a mere private to something so clearly experimental?</p>

<p>Tanya’s gut told her this was dangerous.</p>

<p>And what was that weird computation orb with a similar name?</p>

<p>Before she could pry further, Schugel stormed back in, holding a small device—</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A wristwatch?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>No.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tanya felt a sudden chill.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Wristwatches. Computation orbs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Oh, hell.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Schugel grinned, holding up the device. "We’re going to make a non-mage survive a mage’s battlefield!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tanya swore internally.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This was going to be a nightmare.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: A 'Divine' Miracle</h2>

<h4>
  <b>Central Technology Facility - Testing Grounds</b>
</h4>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s heart pounded in her chest as she saw the supposedly retired mages. The A195 was nothing more than a damned wristwatch that supposedly summoned some kind of shield that, in theory, could simulate mage-like durability. She didn’t trust it for a second. Yet she forced herself to activate the A195.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The shield flickered into existence—nothing more than a pane of glass hovering before her hand.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Schugel, that mad scientist, watched from the sidelines, eyes gleaming with anticipation.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Are you ready?” Schugel’s voice rang out, his usual manic enthusiasm replacing any semblance of concern.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya gritted her teeth and nodded. “Let’s get this over with.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The first mage raised his hand. Tanya’s breath caught in her throat as a formula of fire and explosive magic surged toward her. The shield buzzed in response, shimmering faintly as it absorbed the incoming attack. But it was only a brief reprieve before the magic exploded against the surface, cracking the A195 shield with a sickening sound.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s heart raced. The shield was failing already. She cursed under her breath. This was a joke. A stupid, dangerous joke. If this thing broke completely, she’d be toast.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Another blast came, followed by another, and then a fourth. The cracks spread faster, snaking across the shield as if mocking her. Tanya’s blood ran cold. She could already see the end. Her death, burned to ashes, the A195 shield not nearly strong enough to keep her safe.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Schugel!” a young researcher yelled, her voice laced with panic. “You need to stop this! She’ll die if we don’t—!”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“No!” Schugel snapped, his voice almost gleeful. “If she survives, it’s working. If not, back to the drawing board!”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s mind screamed. This wasn’t just a test. This was madness. And what if the “if” didn’t go her way?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She could feel the world slowing down. The shield’s pane cracked wide open. Tanya’s breath hitched, her eyes wide in horror as the explosive energy ricocheted off the last remaining fragments of the shield. Everything froze. A brilliant, blinding light flooded the area, and the world seemed to stop. She knew, with an unmistakable certainty, that it was him. Being X.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>His voice rang in her mind, reverberating through her skull. “I’ve blessed your shield my child, Strengthening It, It shall protect you. Now go and spread my praise.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya seethed. She didn’t need his blessing. She didn’t need any of this. “I don’t need your shitty blessing!” she shouted into the empty, frozen air, but the voice in her mind didn’t respond. The world slowly unfroze, and when it did, she found herself staring at the shield.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>It was different. New. Stronger.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The cracks had vanished, and in their place, the shield glowed with a faint, golden hue. It didn’t just block the magic anymore. It absorbed it, drawing the power inward.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Divine miracle,” Schugel muttered, his eyes wide in awe. “It’s working better than I could have ever imagined!”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s jaw clenched. She rolled her eyes. This was the worst. She was going to be stuck praising that idiot, Being X, for the rest of her miserable life.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But she couldn’t argue with the results. The shield was stronger than ever. And there was no way she was going to let Being X have the last laugh.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>With a sigh, Tanya turned away from Schugel and the researchers, already growing tired of this. “Get me out of here,” she muttered under her breath, walking toward the door.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>A few hours later, Tanya stood at attention in front of Lieutenant Colonel Lergan, the officer who’d called her in for a new assignment. His eyes narrowed at her, a strange mixture of suspicion and curiosity.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</span>
</p><h4>
  <b>Central Command - Lergens Office</b>
</h4>

<p>
  <span>“You’ve been assigned a new mission, Private Degurechaff,” Lergen said, his tone flat, as though this was an inconvenience rather than an order. “A rescue operation in Arene. The city fell to the Republic early in the war. We need you and a small team to retrieve a few specialists.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s mind raced. Arene. The old supply town. If there were soldiers still alive there after the last fight, they were probably already dead. She’d seen enough of this war to know how quickly a situation could turn.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But then the realization hit her like a wave. This is just another test. A test for the A195. There was no other reason to assign a private as squad leader. She cursed under her breath, her annoyance bubbling over, but she knew better than to argue.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“The A195,” Tanya muttered under her breath. She wasn’t stupid. She’d have to use the cursed thing. Again.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She forced a smile. “Understood, sir. We’ll head out immediately.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Lergen’s eyes flickered over her as though he were trying to read something hidden behind her practiced smile. “Don’t get any ideas about being a hero, Private. And keep your head down. We’re sending you into the thick of it with a few others. The Republic’s presence there is stronger than we anticipated.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya nodded, though inside, she was cursing every step of this assignment. But she couldn’t show that. She had a role to play, and that role was to survive. Whatever the hell the Empire had planned for her, she would play along. For now.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>As she left the briefing room, Lergen’s voice followed her, low and concerned. “What the hell is the Empire thinking, sending children into a war like this?”</span>
</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>
  <b>City of Arene - Ruins</b>
</h4>

<p>
  <span>The city of Arene was in ruins. The once-bustling supply town now lay in the grip of destruction, with barely any signs of life. Tanya’s group trudged through the wreckage, rifles slung over their shoulders, eyes scanning every corner for any sign of movement.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Corporal Wolfram, a reckless one, sighed loudly.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“What the hell is the point of this? It’s not like anyone’s alive by now, right, Commander?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya didn’t respond immediately, her mind already focused on the mission. The others in the group murmured their doubts, but Tanya was resolute. She wasn’t here to babysit. They had a job to do.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Then, a different soldier muttered their frustration,</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Why are we even taking orders from a kid younger than my sister?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>He gestured to Tanya, who stood at the front, keeping her eyes alert.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Wolfram, ever the loudmouth, shot back,</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Shut it, we’ve got orders, we’re doing our damn jobs.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s hand shot up, signaling for the group to stop. A sudden noise from above—a formula—had her instincts kicking into gear.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“FUCK! Mages!” Wolfram shouted, his voice strained with panic.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Without a moment’s hesitation, Tanya barked orders.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Retreat! Take cover in that building!”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The group scattered, sprinting toward a rundown house. Bullets and fire from the mages zipped past, narrowly missing them. As they ducked inside, Tanya could feel the heat from the explosions radiating against the walls. The A195 shield flickered to life in her hands, but it wasn’t enough to protect them all.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The next explosion hit too close. Tanya was thrown back, and only the shield protected her and Wolfram from the worst of it. But she knew they wouldn’t hold much longer.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“We can’t survive hiding forever,” Tanya muttered. “We’re taking them out.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>He stared at her like she’d lost her mind.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Are you insane? Infantry can’t fight mages!”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya glared back.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“You got a better idea?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Wolfram hesitated, then nodded. He’d follow her.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She pushed through the rubble, keeping herself low. Above them, mages hovered, laughing—ready to destroy anything in their path. Tanya raised her binoculars, scanning the sky. Two, four, six mages. A damn platoon.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>With a sigh, she tucked the binoculars into her pocket and drew the A195. The shield flickered to life as she advanced, scanning the street ahead. Wolfram followed a step behind, his movements measured as he prepared to fire.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>"Go for their computation orbs," Tanya ordered, her voice crisp and certain.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Wolfram hesitated, glancing at her. "You sure about that? Those things are small—"</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>"They’re not moving much, and if you hit one, they're done," she cut in. "No barrier, no control. Just a long drop to the ground."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Wolfram clicked his tongue, adjusting his aim. "Tch. Easier said than done."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya didn’t even look at him. "If you can't do it, say so now."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>There was a brief pause. Then Wolfram let out a quiet chuckle.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>"Hell, no. I just don’t want to hear you complain if I miss a few."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>"Then don’t miss."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya moved forward without another word, confidence unwavering. Wolfram exhaled sharply, steadied his rifle, and took aim.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>A loud buzz cut through the air as Wolfram’s shot landed.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The Republican mage jerked mid-air, his body twisting as his computation orb sparked, a bullet lodged deep in its core. His spell flickered—and in the next second, he plummeted.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Another shot. Another mage. Their orb shattered, shards scattering as they crashed to the ground. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Guess the Republic’s orbs have enough resistance not to blow up,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tanya thought.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She grinned, rushing into the opening.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Wolfram fired beside her, finishing off one of the grounded mages.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>“O Lord, grant me strength,”</b>
  <span> she muttered, a golden glow covering the shield pane.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Now only a few feet from the living mages, she dropped a grenade at her feet. The explosion erupted, sending shockwaves through the streets as buildings crumbled further into ruin, with mages scattered like broken dolls.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Five mages were dead. One had been shot by Wolfram, the others by her blast.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Get moving, Wolfram,” Tanya said. “Don’t worry about the missing mage. No one survives a point-blank grenade.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Wolfram hesitated but followed her as ordered.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>As they turned to leave, Tanya spotted a group of Imperial soldiers inside an old building, survivors from the last battle. She felt a strange, fleeting sense of hope.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Well, look at that,” Tanya said, her voice cold but relieved. “Some of them made it.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The A195’s field test was a success, but Tanya wasn’t in the mood for celebrations</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</span>
</p><h4>
  <b>Republic Military HQ</b>
</h4>

<p>
  <span>A group of generals and other high ranking officers convened around a table, staring at the reports from the field. Intelligence suggested that something unusual had happened in Arene, something beyond their comprehension.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>They had recovered footage from the battlefield, where a strange soldier—perhaps even a child—had wielded an orb capable of creating a shield that even their explosive formulas couldn’t break.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Infantry mages,” one of the generals muttered, his disbelief evident. “Mages that don’t even fly…”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“Impossible,” another officer argued. “Not even the Empire would... There’s no way they’ve developed something like this.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But the intelligence reports suggested otherwise. There was a magic signature that didn’t match any known mages, and the damage reports from Arene were inconsistent with any normal battle.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The generals were left speechless. What the hell was the Empire developing?</span>
</p>

<p>─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: A Fleeting Rumor</h2>

<p>
  <b>Central - Zettour’s Office</b>
</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Imperial Army was never quiet, but there was a distinct tension in the air as Brigadier General von Zettour sifted through the latest reports from the frontlines. His sharp eyes scanned through the paperwork before halting on a particular mission report—one that stood out from the rest.</p>

<p>A mere private had led a rescue mission in Arene that not only saved the soldiers but took out five mages, thus securing a significant victory for the Empire. That alone was surprising, but what truly caught his attention was the name.</p>

<p>Private Tanya Degurechaff.</p>

<p>He had heard it before. A name that was attached to a successful operation that was far beyond what was expected of her rank. He had begun to see the report as an exaggeration or mere luck. Especially after viewing her profile, A child of ten years of age, with no schooling besides a year of training.</p>

<p>"Again…" Zettour muttered, rubbing his chin.</p>

<p>A mere private proving herself as a competent officer...again. If she had been a mage, it would have been less surprising. But she wasn’t. She was infantry.</p>

<p>Setting the document down, he exhaled.</p>

<p>"She’ll need to be observed further."</p>

<p>After a moment of thought, he reached for a different file, flipping to the section detailing military commendations. His decision was swift.</p>

<p>He nominated Private Tanya Degurechaff for the Assault Badge.</p>

<p>‘She’s earned it.’</p>

<p>As for himself… he decided he wanted to meet this "prodigy soldier" in person.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>Central - Military Cafè</h4>

<p>For the first time in what felt like forever, Tanya found herself with nothing to do. No assignments, no immediate orders, no superiors breathing down her neck. It was a rare, almost luxurious moment.</p>

<p>She sat in a small café near Central Command, a modest establishment where off-duty soldiers and officers occasionally stopped for a drink. The atmosphere was light, filled with the quiet chatter of men who had survived another day of war.</p>

<p>For Tanya, it was a chance to think, to plan for her next steps.</p>

<p>Or at least, that was the idea.</p>

<p>"Private Degurechaff?"</p>

<p>Tanya nearly choked on her coffee at the sudden voice. Looking up, she found herself staring at a well-dressed officer with piercing eyes. She immediately recognized him, Brigadier General Zettour.</p>

<p>Quickly straightening, she set her drink down and gave a crisp salute.</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>Zettour gave a short nod before gesturing to the seat across from her.</p>

<p>"At ease, Private. Mind if I join you?"</p>

<p>Tanya hesitated for only a second before responding.</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir."</p>

<p>Zettour took a seat, adjusting his uniform before folding his hands in front of him. For a moment, he simply studied her, as if trying to read her. Then, with a neutral expression, he spoke.</p>

<p>"You've been making quite a name for yourself, Degurechaff. Your recent success was… impressive, to say the least."</p>

<p>Tanya, keeping her expression composed, responded carefully.</p>

<p>"I only followed the objective, sir."</p>

<p>Zettour let out a quiet chuckle.</p>

<p>"Of course... But tell me, Private—what motivated you to join the army?"</p>

<p>The question caught Tanya off guard. Her mind stalled.</p>

<p>Motivation?</p>

<p>Tanya felt a cold weight settle in her stomach. She couldn’t answer that.</p>

<p>She had no patriotic drive, no familial legacy to uphold. Her only reason was simple: Survival. She had calculated that joining early and getting out of the orphanage was better than being drafted later, but explaining that wasn’t an option.</p>

<p>As silence stretched between them, Zettour’s sharp gaze took note of the tension in her posture. He seemingly understood.</p>

<p>Instead of pressing further, he smoothly changed the subject.</p>

<p>"How did you feel about leading your last mission?"</p>

<p>Tanya, still caught up in her thoughts, misheard him. She only registered part of the question.</p>

<p>"I feel a platoon would've been better for that mission."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Zettour blinked. Then, he smiled.</p>

<p>‘How bold.’</p>

<p>A mere private asking for a platoon? If nothing else, she was ambitious.</p>

<p>"I see," he responded simply, his expression unreadable.</p>

<p>Tanya frowned. "Sir?"</p>

<p>Zettour only chuckled before moving on, leaving Tanya confused and slightly wary.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4>
  <b>****** ******* - ******</b>
</h4>

<p>Two mages sat in a locked room.</p>

<p>Their conversation was hushed but intense.</p>

<p>"You heard the news?"</p>

<p>The first mage glanced over his shoulder as if ensuring no one else was listening. He leaned in, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>"You've heard, haven't you?" the mage asked, his tone filled with excitement. "About the new battalion?"</p>

<p>The second mage nodded, a knowing smirk on his face. "The one led by the miracle causer? The one who made Schugel's orb work? How could I not?"</p>

<p>The first mage leaned back, tapping his fingers against the table thoughtfully. "I heard the brass is serious about it. They're forming a special unit, focused on tactical surprise. A mage battalion that could actually stand up to the Republic."</p>

<p>His companion raised an eyebrow. "You think they have what it takes?"</p>

<p>A pause hung between them, as both mages recalled the recent reports about ******. </p>

<p>"If it's the one who survived that madness with Schugel's project, they've got something no one else does. That orb…it worked." The mage shook his head, still trying to grasp the full implications. "Whoever is leading this battalion could be a game-changer."</p>

<p>The second mage scratched his chin, his brow furrowing in concentration. "Ah, right... What was the name of the leader again? Major..." He trailed off, unable to recall the name.</p>

<p>The first mage snapped his fingers in frustration. "Damn it, I knew it just a second ago. Major—"</p>

<p>The conversation was cut off, as the door slid open with a sharp creak, signaling the end of their discussion.</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p><h4 align="left">
  <b>Republican </b>
  <b>Military HQ</b>
</h4>

<p>The Republican high command was in chaos.</p>

<p>The leadership were clashing over their next course of action. Some generals argued for aggression, believing that the Empire was on the backfoot. Others demanded caution, warning that the enemy was evolving far too quickly.</p>

<p>At the center of it all were rumors.</p>

<p>Reports suggested the Empire was forming a new elite mage battalion, led by the same mage rumored to have caused the chaos at *****<em>.</em></p>

<p>If true, it would be more dangerous than the infantry mage theory that had previously been feared.</p>

<p>"First, they develop an unknown soldier with absurd defensive capabilities," one officer growled. "And now this?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Vianto, leader of the Republic’s most elite mage company, leaned forward, voice calm but firm.</p>

<p>"We should focus on the infantry mage first. That is a confirmed threat. We don’t even know if this ‘battalion’ is real."</p>

<p>Another general shook his head.</p>

<p>"If it’s real, and we ignore it, we could be making a fatal mistake."</p>

<p>The chatter was broken as an officer from Republic Intelligence entered the room, carrying a sealed document.</p>

<p>"The Commonwealth has responded."</p>

<p>Silence fell.</p>

<p>"Their answer?" one of the higher-ups demanded.</p>

<p>The officer exhaled.</p>

<p>"They will be sending two mage battalions to assist both the Republic and the Entente Alliance. Additionally, they will aid espionage."</p>

<p>A brief murmur of approval started to spread through the room.</p>

<p>"However," the officer continued, "they have made it clear that this is the extent of their involvement. The Commonwealth intends to maintain neutrality."</p>

<p>The mood soured.</p>

<p>Frustration and uncertainty spread through the ranks. Some saw this as valuable support, while others saw it as the Commonwealth refusing to commit.</p>

<p>The meeting ended with one thought echoing throughout.</p>

<p>‘The Advantage they had from the early victories was fading. <strong>Fast</strong>’</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: A Surprise Promotion

<h4>
  <b>Imperial Dinner Hall</b>
</h4>

<p>
  <span>The grand halls of the Imperial military’s officer quarters were far too lavish for Tanya’s tastes. She wasn’t one for pointless ceremonies or luxurious gatherings, especially when she was certain that nothing good ever came out of them for a low-ranking soldier.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She had been summoned here unexpectedly. That alone was enough to put her on edge. She knew what this place was. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is where promotions happen… or death sentences are issued.</span>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <span>As she stepped into the private dining room, she immediately noted the two men seated at the long table. One she recognized from her reports and recent meeting at the cafe—Brigadier General von Zettour, The other was Colonel von Kordel, a man she knew little about beyond his administrative work.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She saluted stiffly. “Private Tanya Degurechaff, reporting as ordered.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Zettour gestured for her to relax, and Colonel Kordel smiled. “At ease, Lieutenant.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya blinked. “...Pardon?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Kordel chuckled. “Second Lieutenant Degurechaff. Congratulations, your recent successes have earned you a well-deserved promotion.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>What the hell?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tanya barely managed to keep her shock from showing. This wasn’t just a jump in rank—it was an </span>
  <em>
    <span>absurd</span>
  </em>
  <span> leap. From private to lieutenant? That wasn’t how things worked.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She tried to compose herself, her mind racing. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What kind of trap is this?</span>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“I… I don’t understand, sir,” Tanya finally stammered, carefully choosing her words. “How was I promoted like this?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Kordel waved a hand dismissively. “Come now, no need to be modest. You’ve proven yourself time and time again. You’ve led successful operations, shown strategic thinking, and we believe you are capable of more.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s lips tightened. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Capable of more’? That doesn’t explain why they’re promoting me at breakneck speed.</span>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Kordel’s smirk grew wider. “Of course, if you’d rather avoid the responsibilities of an officer, we could reconsider… Perhaps a sergeant promotion would be more to your liking?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya felt her stomach twist. That was no real choice. It was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>formality</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Either she accepted the lieutenant rank, or they would toss her aside entirely.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She forced a smile. “I wouldn’t dream of rejecting the Empire’s trust, sir.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Kordel gave a satisfied nod, then stood. “Good. Well then, I’ll leave you two to discuss the specifics.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>With that, he excused himself, leaving Tanya alone with Zettour.</span>
</p><h4>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</h4>

<p>
  <span>Zettour exhaled slowly, his relaxed demeanor making the tension in the room feel heavier. He studied her for a moment before speaking.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“I assume you’d like to cut to the chase.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya gave a short nod.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>He leaned back. “Your promotion wasn’t easy to push through, given the circumstances. But in the end, the General Staff approved it because we have a special task for you.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Her mind raced. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Circumstances? What circumstances?</span>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“You will be leading a new platoon,” Zettour continued. “One that will act largely independently under the General Staff’s command.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya stiffened. “A… platoon?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Zettour nodded. “Your orders will be similar to those given to the newly formed mage battalion.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya’s breath caught. </span>
  <em>
    <span>The rumored independent mage battalion?</span>
  </em>
  <span> She’d assumed it was just speculation among the officers, but if Zettour was saying it directly, that meant it was real.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>And that meant something </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> troubling.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>So that’s why securing permission was difficult… Zettour is already handling an entire battalion of mages. That’s far more valuable than an infantry platoon.</span>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Mages would always be the priority. That was simply reality. The fact that Zettour was willing to tell her about the battalion’s existence meant only one thing—this was a veiled threat.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Accept this job or else.’</span>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya forced a calm expression and nodded. “Understood, sir.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Zettour gave a small approving smile. “Good. You’ll be able to select your own men, though there are restrictions. No more than thirty members, and no soldiers from the Western or Northern groups, and try to limit those from Central.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya barely managed to suppress her grimace. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What?! Only thirty… and no West or North?</span>
  </em>
  <span> That meant no experienced veterans, no hardened front-line soldiers.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She swallowed her frustration. “Of course.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>With that, she excused herself from the room, stepping into the hallway and barely resisting the urge to curse out loud.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>What the hell kind of disaster have I walked into?</span>

</p><h4>
  <b>203rd Mage Battalion</b>
</h4>

<p>
  <span>The barracks of the Empire’s elite mage battalion were unusually quiet. The men and women of the 203rd were gathered for a briefing, standing at attention as their commander strode forward.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Their leader didn’t waste time. “Orders just came in.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>A brief pause. “The Empire has pinpointed a Republican forward command center. We are to destroy it before the upcoming offensive.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Silence followed. No one spoke, but the air was heavy with unspoken tension.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>After dismissing the unit, the commander walked through the dimly lit halls of the barracks, deep in thought.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>A voice interrupted.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“You look troubled, Commander.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The commander turned to see First Lieutenant *********** leaning casually against the wall, arms crossed.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The commander sighed. “This mission… it feels like we’re being thrown into a meat grinder.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>*********** scoffed. “Of course we are. That’s what battalions like ours are good for—big, flashy, and sadly disposable.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The commander frowned. “So what? We just do it anyway?”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>A smirk tugged at the corners of ***********’s  lips. “What else? Either we succeed and they praise us, or we die and they pretend to mourn. Personally, I’d rather be alive to hear the praise.”</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The commander sighed. “Agreed”</span>
</p>

<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p>

<p>
  <b>Central - Assignment Room</b>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The room was a disaster.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Stacks of folders covered every surface, documents scattered in what should have been an orderly selection process.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Tanya sat at the center of the mess, hands clasped as she stared at the files in front of her.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Each folder represented a volunteer—soldiers eager to join her new platoon. Soldiers who had no idea that they were about to be led by someone who had never even </span>
  <em>
    <span>attended</span>
  </em>
  <span> an officer’s academy.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>She exhaled sharply.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>One thought repeated in her mind.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>How?!</span>
  </em>
</p>

<p>─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</p>

<h2>Chapter 7: Trial by Fire</h2>

<h4>
  <b>Airspace - Rhine</b>
</h4>

<p>The 203rd launched at dawn.</p>

<p>They cut through the sky, flying low over the treetops, skimming the terrain to avoid detection. Their formation was tight, their movements precise.</p>

<p>Watchtowers loomed in the distance. The battalion adjusted, slipping past enemy radar stations undetected. Everything was going smoothly almost too smoothly.</p>

<p>Then, trouble.</p>

<p>A flare of hostile magic burned through the early morning mist.</p>

<p>"Enemy fire incoming!"</p>

<p>A hidden anti-air mage unit had spotted them. Before anyone could react, a concentrated volley of explosive formulas detonated in their path.</p>

<p>The battalion scattered, dodging through the chaos.</p>

<p>A scream tore through the air. One of their own was hit!</p>

<p>His orb flickered out, and his body spiraled downward, lost to the abyss below.</p>

<p>The commander clenched her teeth. No time to mourn. No time to hesitate. If they stalled now, they were as good as dead.</p>

<p>"Company 3 and 4, suppress those mages! 1st and 2nd, follow me! We’re hitting the HQ before they can regroup!"</p>

<p>Orders given. No hesitation. The 203rd split, diving into the storm.</p>

<p>The Republic barely had time to react before the first wave struck.</p>

<p>Mages of the 203rd rained destruction from above</p>

<p>The Republican officers scrambled.</p>

<p>"They’re here?! Where are the defenses?!"</p>

<p>"Sir, conflicting reports! Some say it's a scouting force, others-"</p>

<p>A blast of raw magical energy tore through the command room, silencing the conversation permanently.</p>

<p>The commander pulled her arm back, smoke still curling from her fingertips. The objective was beyond clear; eliminate everyone.</p>

<p>***********’s company cleared the resistance methodically.</p>

<p>A truck screeched away from the base, attempting to flee. One of their mages dived, flipping the vehicle effortlessly. The soldiers inside didn’t last long.</p>

<p>The command center was in ruins.</p>

<p>"Mission complete," someone muttered.</p>

<p>But…</p><h4>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</h4>

<p>"They’re here!"</p>

<p>A full Republican mage battalion descended upon them.</p>

<p>"Eliminate the 203rd! No survivors!"</p>

<p>Fire and magic clashed in the air. The sky became a battlefield, spells colliding in brilliant bursts of destruction.</p>

<p>The 203rd fought fiercely, but the cracks were forming. The Republic's mages were far too coordinated, and they had the numbers, this had to be a named unit.</p>

<p>One by one, the 203rd started dropping.</p>

<p>***********’s barrier shattered under a precision shot. She twisted her body at the last second, barely avoiding death.</p>

<p>The commander cursed under her breath. They had to retreat.</p>

<p>"Fall back!"</p>

<p>They broke away, fighting for every inch of airspace. But the Republic wasn’t letting them go easily.</p>

<p>A final shot tore through the battlefield, aimed straight at the commander.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A burning streak of light.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Too fast to dodge.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She braced.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yet right before it connected a barrier flared to life in front of her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A defensive formula!?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>First Lieutenant Weiss?!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The shot struck the barrier, the force sending Weiss stumbling, but the shield held.</p>

<p>The Republican mage cursed and pulled back.</p>

<p>The commander exhaled, steadying herself. That was too close.</p>

<p>Weiss grinned, shaking his hand from the effort. "You’re lucky I’m here."</p>

<p>*********** scoffed. "Lucky, huh? I’d say it’s more like fate."</p>

<p>She turned to the commander, exhaustion in her eyes.</p>

<p>"That was hell, Aleksandria."</p>

<p>The name lingered in the air.</p>

<p>The commander, Aleksandria sighed.</p>

<p>They lost nearly two companies. If this kept up they weren't going to survive the year.</p><h4>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</h4><h4>
  <b>Central -  Zettour’s Office</b>
</h4>

<p>Zettour sat at his desk, scanning the latest report. His fingers tapped against the wooden surface as he read the casualty count.</p>

<p>Mission successful, but at this cost?</p>

<p>"The Republic isn’t as reckless as we’d like to hope," he muttered, rubbing his temples. If this continued, they wouldn’t have a mage battalion left to command.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, deep in thought. This was far from over. </p><h4>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</h4><h4>
  <b>203rd Mage Battalion</b>
</h4>

<p>Aleksandria sat on her bed, staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>*********** leaned against the doorway, arms crossed.</p>

<p>"Rough day."</p>

<p>Aleksandria let out a tired laugh. "That’s one way to put it."</p>

<p>Silence stretched between them before *********** spoke again.</p>

<p>"At least we lived, Aleksandria."</p>

<p>Aleksandria closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"This time, Visha"</p><h4>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</h4><h4>
  <b>Central– Tanya’s Assignment Room</b>
</h4>

<p>Newly appointed Second Lieutenant Tanya Degurechaff was drowning in paperwork.</p>

<p>She had given up all hope of organizing the files properly. No matter how she stacked them, they only seemed to multiply.</p>

<p>She sighed, leaning back in her chair.</p>

<p>This was reminding her too much of her past life. The endless reports, the bureaucracy, it was the same corporate world, just with a military twist.</p>

<p>Always waiting for her secretary to bring papers.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Then, a thought struck her.</p>

<p>She needed a secretary.</p>

<p>Her adjunct was supposed to assist with logistics, weren't they?</p>

<p>"Adjunct!" she called.</p>

<p>A knock came at the door almost instantly.</p>

<p>A man stepped in, grinning like he had all the time in the world.</p>

<p>"Nice to see you again, Taya."</p>

<p>Tanya’s eye twitched.</p>
