            <h2>Chapter 1: A Private’s War</h2>
			<p>The forest was deathly quiet.</p>
			<p>Snow crunched beneath heavy boots, and breath misted in the frozen air, but no one spoke. The squad moved carefully, rifles raised, eyes scanning for movement between the trees. Somewhere ahead, hidden beyond the thick woods, lay their objective—the Entente Alliance’s supply facility. Their orders were simple: recon the area and report back. Engagement was to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.</p>
			<p>Tanya Degurechaff, Private First Class, gripped her rifle tighter and exhaled slowly.</p>
			<p>"This is idiotic," she thought. "Half the squad’s fresh out of accelerated training, our leader’s too eager for action, and Command clearly has no idea what they’re doing." </p>
			<p>Sergeant Richer, their commanding officer, crouched near a fallen log and raised a fist, signaling the squad to halt. “Eyes sharp. We’re close,” he whispered. “Two scouts, forward.”</p>
			<p>Tanya watched as two soldiers crept ahead, moving like ghosts through the underbrush. The plan was simple: they’d confirm enemy presence, report back, and—</p>
			<p>A gunshot shattered the silence.</p>
			<p>Then another.</p>
			<p>The scouts didn’t return.</p>
			<p>“Shit!” someone cursed. A split-second later, a hail of bullets tore through the trees.</p>
			<p>The squad scattered, diving for cover as enemy fire rained down. Tanya flattened herself behind a thick oak, heart hammering against her ribs.</p>
			<p>"Ambush!" Richer shouted. "Return fire!"</p>
			<p>Bullets zipped past. Someone screamed. Tanya forced herself to stay calm, peeking out just enough to fire a shot. An Entente soldier dropped, but more swarmed forward. This wasn’t just a random patrol—this was a kill squad.</p>
			<p>Then, it happened.</p>
			<p>A mage soared above the treetops, glowing with blue energy. His rifle sparked as he aimed downward—</p>
			<p>Sergeant Richer’s head snapped back, blood spraying into the snow.</p>
			<p>For a moment, the battlefield went still.</p>
			<p>Then chaos erupted.</p>
			<p>"Sergeant’s down!" someone yelled.</p>
			<p>“Shit—what do we do!?”</p>
			<p>A panicked voice screamed, “We need orders!”</p>
			<p><em>Orders?</em> Who the hell was going to—</p>
			<p>A sharp buzz crackled through Tanya’s radio. “Squad, report!” Command Post.</p>
			<p>Tanya’s fingers were ice-cold as she pressed the radio to her mouth. “Sergeant Richer is KIA! We’re pinned down!”</p>
			<p>A brief silence. Then: “You’re in command now, Private Degurechaff.”</p>
			<p>She nearly dropped the radio.</p>
			<p>"I’m what?"</p>
			<p>“This is a battlefield, soldier! Your squad needs a leader—now lead!”</p>
			<p>The line cut off.</p>
			<p>Tanya’s brain stalled.</p>
			<p>She was a private. She was not supposed to lead. She was not supposed to be making tactical decisions. This was so far above her damn pay grade—</p>
			<p>The sound of gunfire snapped her back to reality. Focus. Think.</p>
			<p>The squad was falling apart, and if they stayed here, they’d be wiped out. They needed to move. They needed to fight.</p>
			<p>Tanya’s grip on her rifle tightened. “Listen up, you idiots!” she snapped. “If we stay here, we’re dead! Fall back, and follow my lead!”</p>
			<p>“Why the hell should we—”</p>
			<p>“Because if you don’t, you’re already corpses! MOVE!”</p>
			<p>It wasn’t a strategy. It was desperation. But it worked.</p>
			<p>The squad broke from cover, retreating into the trees with Tanya at the front. Bullets whizzed past, but the trees provided just enough cover to keep them alive.</p>
			<p>They ran.</p>
			<p>And then they ran straight into the enemy supply facility.</p>
			<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p>
			<p>Tanya’s breath came in sharp gasps as she took in the sight before her.</p>
			<p>A storage yard filled with crates. Fuel drums stacked in the open. A perfect weak point.</p>
			<p>A wicked grin crept onto her face. "Oh, this will do nicely."</p>
			<p>“Set charges on the fuel tanks!” she barked. “We’re blowing this place sky-high!”</p>
			<p>No arguments this time. The squad moved fast, setting explosives as Tanya kept an eye on the perimeter. They were on borrowed time.</p>
			<p>With a final click, the charges were set. Tanya didn’t hesitate—</p>
			<p>“FIRE IN THE HOLE!”</p>
			<p>BOOM.</p>
			<p>The shockwave sent snow flying as fire roared through the facility. Enemy soldiers scrambled in the chaos, but Tanya wasn’t done yet.</p>
			<p>She spotted another structure deeper in the woods—a storage bunker. Guards posted. Probably holding something important.</p>
			<p>Her rifle snapped up, targeting the mage on duty.</p>
			<p>One shot.</p>
			<p>The bullet struck the mage’s flight orb. It crackled—then exploded.</p>
			<p>The resulting blast ignited the nearby artillery shells.</p>
			<p>Another boom.</p>
			<p>Tanya turned to her squad, smirking. “That’s two facilities down. Time to leave before we overstay our welcome.”</p>
			<p>They vanished into the forest as Entente reinforcements arrived too late.</p>
			<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p>
			<h3><strong>Military Command Meeting – Imperial Headquarters</strong></h3>
			<p>The air in the briefing room was tense.</p>
			<p>Brigadier General Zettour sat at the head of the table, fingers steepled, listening as the intelligence officer read the latest field reports.</p>
			<p>“Casualties were minimal. However, we lost Sergeant Richer early in the operation.”</p>
			<p>A murmur spread through the room.</p>
			<p>Zettour frowned. “And yet, the mission resulted in the destruction of two major supply facilities?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
			<p>Zettour nodded. “That makes sense. Richer was an exceptional soldier. It’s only natural he’d—”</p>
			<p>“Sir,” the intelligence officer interrupted, voice hesitant. “Sergeant Richer was killed almost immediately. Someone else took over.”</p>
			<p>Zettour’s brow furrowed. “Who?”</p>
			<p>The officer swallowed. “A member of his squad, sir.”</p>
			<p>The room erupted.</p>
			<p>“Who the hell—”<br>“A non-officer led the mission?”<br>“Who gave them command?”</p>
			<p>Zettour slammed his hand on the table. “Enough! Who was it?”</p>
			<p>The intelligence officer fumbled with a file, pushing it forward. “Sir, the thing is, she—”</p>
			<p>Zettour’s eyes flicked to the name on the report.</p>
			<p><strong>Private Tanya Degurechaff.</strong></p>
			<p>The silence was deafening.</p><p>“Bring me everything we have on this private.”</p>
			
			<h2>Chapter 2: Orders from Above</h2>
			<h3><strong>Rhine Front Command - General Staff Office</strong></h3>
			<p>Zettour sat in his office, flipping through the personnel file of the supposed genius behind the Entente Alliance supply depot attack. He had expected a decorated support, perhaps a young prodigy from the war academies—someone with an extensive service record or, at the very least, a tactician trained in strategic warfare.</p>
			<p>Instead, the file in front of him was... barren.</p>
			<p>The first page contained the basics: Name: Tanya Degurechaff. Age: 9. Rank: Private. Zettour frowned. Nine? That couldn't be right. It had to be a clerical mistake. The date of birth must have been recorded incorrectly.</p>
			<p>His brow furrowed as he skimmed the page. No advanced schooling. No tactical courses. Not even civilian schooling. Only one year of military training? That alone was suspicious. Either this was an error, or someone was intentionally hiding information.</p>
			<p>He turned to the second page, which contained the field report Tanya had submitted regarding the mission. The summary was dry, straightforward, and professional. There was no embellishment or attempt to take credit—just a concise description of the operation.</p>

			<p>Zettour moved on to the third page: a record of Tanya’s military achievements and failures. It only contained two entries.</p>

			<p>Successes: Destruction of an enemy supply depot and weapons storage facility.</p>

			<p>Failures: Minor strategic error during first mission.</p>

			<p>Zettour blinked. She’s only been on two missions?!</p>

			<p>If he hadn't seen the intelligence report himself, he would have thought this was a joke. He flipped to the last page and nearly dropped the file.</p>

			<p>The final page was a photograph. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed child in an Imperial uniform stood at attention.</p>

			<p>Zettour exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. This is correct? This is the soldier who just blew up a key Entente weapons facility?</p>

			<p>The office remained silent as he processed what he had just leArened.</p>

			<h3><strong>Central Research Division - Doctor Schugel’s Office</strong></h3>

			<p>Doctor Adelheid von Schugel adjusted his glasses, his eyes scanning through lists of potential candidates for his latest experimental project—the A195 Shield. A breakthrough device, one that could change the future of infantry warfare. But he needed the right subject for testing. Someone... durable.</p>

			<p>As he flipped through the personnel records, one file immediately caught his attention. A small smirk tugged at his lips as he skimmed the details.</p>

			<p>Name: Tanya Degurechaff.</p>

			<p>Rank: Private</p>

			<p>Age: 9</p>

			<p>"Yes… she’ll be perfect."</p>

			<h3><strong>Rhine Front - Tanya’s Tent</strong></h3>

			<p>Tanya sighed, leaning against the cot in her tent at the Rhine front base. Well, I suppose I should be grateful I’m not in the trenches right now.</p>

			<p>Two days had passed since the ridiculous assignment that should have been way above her pay grade. The squad leader had been killed, the command post had panicked, and somehow, somehow, Tanya had been the one to take charge.</p>

			<p>She shook her head, smirking. "Hah, maybe this’ll get me a promotion."</p>

			<p>At this rate, I’ll be a lieutenant before I hit ten.</p>

			<p>The thought was amusing enough that she let out a small chuckle before speaking internally to Being X, taunting the so-called "god" about how well she was doing despite his interference.</p>

			<p>Her amusement was short-lived when a representative from the command post stepped into her tent.</p>

			<p>"Private Degurechaff," the man said with a hesitant nod.</p>

			<p>Tanya put on her most neutral expression. "Sir?"</p>

			<p>The officer cleared his throat, looking slightly uncomfortable. "We… apologize for the last mission. The command post was in disarray after Sergeant Richter’s death, and in the panic, we—"</p>

			<p>"It was no big deal," Tanya interrupted, maintaining her polite tone while internally cursing them out. If you can throw me into a command position mid-battle, why not move me to the damn rear?!</p>

			<p>The representative coughed before handing her a document. "You’ve been issued a new deployment order. The Technology Division has requested you for testing."</p>

			<p>Tanya blinked, staring at the paper.</p>

			<p>Testing?</p>

			<p>Suppressing the urge to smile, she forced herself to read through the document carefully before responding.</p>

			<p>"I understand, sir. Thank you for the notice."</p>

			<p>The officer visibly flinched, taking an unconscious step back. The look in Tanya’s neutral expression sent a chill down his spine. How can a child exude such... presence?</p>

			<p>He quickly excused himself and left.</p>

			<p>Tanya exhaled through her nose, gripping the document. No more frontlines. No more random bullets flying at me. No more idiots playing hero.</p>

			<p>She had officially been transferred out of active combat.</p>

			<h3><strong>Rhine Front - Departure</strong></h3>

			<p>Tanya stood in front of her squad, listening as the soldiers joked around.</p>

			<p>"Man, what are we gonna do without our new commander?" one of them laughed.</p>

			<p>"Yeah, Tanya, don’t forget about us when you’re busy playing with gadgets back in Central!"</p>

			<p>"Try not to get blown up, alright?"</p>

			<p>Tanya rolled her eyes, waving them off. "Yeah, yeah, I’ll miss you idiots too."</p>

			<p>Despite her casual response, she could feel a strange weight in her chest. Damn, I actually got attached to these fools.</p>

			<p>But sentimentality wouldn’t help her survive.</p>

			<p>Without looking back, she boarded the train to Central.</p>

			<h3><strong>On the Train to Central</strong></h3>

			<p>Tanya leaned back in her seat, skimming through the report on her upcoming assignment.</p>

			<p>A195 Shield…</p>

			<p>The document claimed it was a new experimental device to assist infantry in tanking fire. A new type of armor? A riot shield? A reinforced vest?</p>

			<p>Why were they bringing a private from the front to test it?</p>

			<p>Her eyes drifted to a smaller line of text near the bottom.</p>

			<p>"Private Tanya Degurechaff will be retested for magical aptitude upon arrival and before testing."</p>

			<p>She snorted. "Pfft—HAHAHA! Magic?! These morons seriously think I can develop magic overnight?!"</p>

			<p>If she had magic, she wouldn't be stuck in the trenches. She’d be living the easy life as an aerial mage, far away from the mud and blood of the frontlines.</p>

			<p>But… what if they expected her to have magic?</p>

			<p>Her laughter died down as she furrowed her brows.</p>

			<p>Wait. If I don’t have magic, will they just send me back?</p>

			<p>She tried to reassure herself. It was probably just a formality. Yeah, that's why it was in a different font. Just a standard test. Nothing to worry about… right?</p>

			<p>As she mulled over the implications, she barely noticed the tall, brown-haired officer who had entered the train car.</p>

			<p>He spotted Tanya sitting in her seat.</p>

			<p>His gaze lingered on her for a moment before he started walking over.</p>
			
			<h2>Chapter 3: Unwanted Attention</h2>

			<p>Tanya sat in the train car, arms crossed, staring blankly at the passing scenery. The rhythmic clatter of the rails was a small comfort—steady, predictable. Unlike whatever bureaucratic nonsense awaited her in Central. She had no illusions about the military’s generosity; she was being sent somewhere, and that somewhere likely had strings attached.</p>

			<p>As the train rattled on, she caught movement in her peripheral vision. A man, brown-haired, sharp-eyed, dressed in an officer’s uniform. He was watching her.</p>

			<p>Tanya suppressed a sigh. Another curious onlooker. She’d gotten plenty of those ever since the battlefield. Too young. Too small. Too competent.</p>

			<p>The man approached.</p>

			<p>"Interesting uniform for someone your size," he remarked casually, taking the seat across from her. His tone was light, but his gaze was studying her intently.</p>

			<p>Tanya forced a polite smile. "Is it? It fits just fine."</p>

			<p>He chuckled, leaning back slightly, but not relaxing. "That’s not what I meant. The battlefield isn’t kind to children playing soldier."</p>

			<p>Tanya’s smile twitched, but she kept her irritation in check. "Good thing I’m not playing, then."</p>

			<p>The officer hummed thoughtfully. "I take it you’ve seen action."</p>

			<p>"Something like that."</p>

			<p>He tilted his head, as if considering something. "What unit were you with?"</p>

			<p>"203rd. Infantry." She kept her answer clipped and controlled, though the last word was barely audible.</p>

			<p>"Haven’t heard of them."</p>

			<p>"We didn’t have the luxury of making a name for ourselves."</p>

			<p>"Hm." He let that sit for a moment. "And where’d you train?"</p>

			<p>Tanya shrugged. "Nowhere special."</p>

			<p>The man was testing her, she realized. Subtly probing. Seeing if she’d slip up. He still wasn’t sure if she was some child with delusions of grandeur or something else entirely.</p>

			<p>Fine. Two could play that game.</p>

			<p>"I assume you trained somewhere prestigious," she said, feigning polite curiosity. "Maybe one of the mage academies?"</p>

			<p>His eyebrows twitched upward ever so slightly. Got him.</p>

			<p>"I did, actually," he admitted, watching for a reaction. "You’ve heard of Kriegsschule, I assume?"</p>

			<p>Tanya nodded like it was the most natural thing in the world. "Of course."</p>

			<p>In truth, she barely knew anything about it. The name was vaguely familiar—one of the many institutions that trained mages. But she wasn’t about to give him the satisfaction of looking ignorant.</p>

			<p>The officer studied her for another long moment. Then, seemingly satisfied, he stood. "Well, whatever the case, I’ll be looking forward to seeing your career develop."</p>

			<p>He gave a small smirk before turning to leave.</p>

			<p>"Hope to see you in the air sometime."</p>

			<p>Tanya froze.</p>

			<p>Air?</p>

			<p>She replayed the conversation in her head. He thought—no, he assumed—she was a mage. Of course he did. That explained everything.</p>

			<p>She barely suppressed a groan. Fantastic. That was going to bite her later.</p>

			<p>—</p>

			<p>When she stepped off the train, Tanya was met with a stark contrast to the mud and blood of the frontlines. The facility before her was sleek, industrial, and intimidatingly clean.</p>

			<p>No trenches. No artillery screaming overhead.</p>

			<p>For the first time in a while, she felt a small flicker of relief.</p>

			<p>A stiff-looking officer was waiting for her, barely sparing her a glance before barking, "Follow me."</p>

			<p>Tanya did.</p>

			<p>She was led through pristine halls, passing by officers and researchers who didn’t so much as blink at her presence. Unlike the battlefield, where she was either underestimated or gawked at, here she was just another asset. A tool being shuffled from one place to another.</p>

			<p>The first stop was a check-up.</p>

			<p>Height. Weight. Reflexes. Cold, methodical. She was treated like a specimen more than a person. She briefly considered mouthing off, but she knew better than to antagonize bureaucrats needlessly.</p>

			<p>Then came the magic aptitude test.</p>

			<p>A stone tablet. A single touch was all it took.</p>

			<p>The result?</p>

			<h3>G.</h3>

			<p>Not F. Worse.</p>

			<p>She had been unsuitable before, but G was something else entirely. A magic aptitude so bad that even standing too close to an activated mage orb could cause interference with it.</p>

			<p>Tanya expected it. But seeing the test proctors exchange baffled, disgusted looks still irked her.</p>

			<p>A few of them muttered amongst themselves.</p>

			<p>"Is this really what Schugel wanted?"</p>

			<p>"Unbelievable. A waste of testing materials."</p>

			<p>Some shot her barely concealed glares. She wasn’t just an unsuitable test subject—she was an insult.</p>

			<p>Then, the doors burst open.</p>

			<p>"Perfect!"</p>

			<p>The man who entered was tall, wild-eyed, and carrying the unmistakable air of a lunatic.</p>

			<p>Tanya barely had time to react before he grabbed her wrist.</p>

			<p>"Ah—what—?"</p>

			<p>The test proctors snapped to attention. "Doctor Schugel—are you sure—"</p>

			<p>Schugel.</p>

			<p>Realization clicked in Tanya’s head. This was the damn scientist who wanted her?!</p>

			<p>Schugel ignored the protests and dragged her along the hall.</p>

			<p>"Wait a second—!" Tanya twisted slightly, trying to get a look at him. "What the hell is this about?"</p>

			<p>"No magic, but you performed that well in battle? Now that’s interesting!"</p>

			<p>Oh. He was insane.</p>

			<p>Tanya let out a slow breath. No point arguing with a madman.</p>

			<p>Schugel pulled her into another room.</p>

			<p>There, on a pedestal, sat what looked like a sleek, experimental mage orb.</p>

			<p>She looked at the name labelled below it: Type 95 Computation Orb?</p>

			<p>Schugel finally let go of her, rushing off to finish whatever paperwork was needed to secure her as a test subject.</p>

			<p>Tanya, finally free, turned to the other staff. "What exactly is the A195?"</p>

			<p>The researchers exchanged looks, surprised by her directness, before seemingly deciding she was important enough to answer.</p>

			<p>One of them—a younger woman—picked up an old military shield. "You’re familiar with these, right? The A195 is like a combination of this and a mage’s orb."</p>

			<p>Tanya narrowed her eyes. "Explain."</p>

			<p>The woman perked up, clearly eager. "It allows the user to create an energy barrier in front of their hand, one that can be moved and directed! Theoretically, it should be able to withstand—"</p>

			<p>She launched into a long-winded explanation. Tanya tuned out the excitement, focusing instead on what wasn’t being said.</p>

			<p>Why test this on her?</p>

			<p>Why assign a mere private to something so clearly experimental?</p>

			<p>Tanya’s gut told her this was dangerous.</p>

			<p>And what was that weird mage orb with a similar name?</p>

			<p>Before she could pry further, Schugel stormed back in, holding a small device—</p>

			<p>A wristwatch?</p>

			<p>No.</p>

			<p>Tanya felt a sudden chill.</p>

			<p>Wristwatches. Mage orbs.</p>

			<p>Oh, hell.</p>

			<p>Schugel grinned, holding up the device. "We’re going to make a non-mage survive a mage’s battlefield!"</p>

			<p>Tanya swore internally.</p>

			<p>This was going to be a nightmare.</p>

			
			<h2>Chapter 4: A Divine Miracle</h2>
			
    <p>Tanya’s heart pounded in her chest as she saw the normaly retired mages. The A195 was nothing more than a damned wristwatch that supposedly summoned some kind of shield that, in theory, could simulate mage-like durability. She didn’t trust it for a second. She activated the A195.</p>

    <p>The shield flickered into existence—nothing more than a pane of glass hovering before her hand.</p>

    <p><strong>Schugel</strong>, that mad scientist, watched from the sidelines, eyes gleaming with anticipation.</p>

    <p>“Are you ready?” Schugel’s voice rang out, his usual manic enthusiasm replacing any semblance of concern.</p>

    <p>Tanya gritted her teeth and nodded. “Let’s get this over with.”</p>

    <p>The first mage raised his hand. Tanya’s breath caught in her throat as a formula of fire and explosive magic surged toward her. The shield buzzed in response, shimmering faintly as it absorbed the incoming attack. But it was only a brief reprieve before the magic exploded against the surface, cracking the A195 shield with a sickening sound.</p>

    <p>Tanya’s heart raced. The shield was failing already. She cursed under her breath. This was a joke. A stupid, dangerous joke. If this thing broke completely, she’d be toast.</p>

    <p>Another blast came, followed by another, and then a third. The cracks spread faster, snaking across the shield as if mocking her. Tanya’s blood ran cold. She could already see the end. Her death, burned to ashes, the A195 shield not nearly strong enough to keep her safe.</p>

    <p>“Schugel!” a young researcher yelled, her voice laced with panic. “You need to stop this! She’ll die if we don’t—!”</p>

    <p>“No!” Schugel snapped, his voice almost gleeful. “If she survives, it’s working. If not, back to the drawing board!”</p>

    <p>Tanya’s mind screamed. This wasn’t just a test. This was madness. And what if the “if” didn’t go her way?</p>

    <p>She could feel the world slowing down. The shield’s pane cracked wide open. Tanya’s breath hitched, her eyes wide in horror as the explosive energy ricocheted off the last remaining fragments of the shield. Everything froze. A brilliant, blinding light flooded the room, and the world seemed to stop. She knew, with an unmistakable certainty, that it was him. Being X.</p>

    <p>His voice rang in her mind, reverberating through her skull. <em>“I’ve blessed this shield. It will protect you now.”</em></p>

    <p>Tanya seethed. She didn’t need his blessing. She didn’t need any of this. “I don’t need your shitty blessing!” she shouted into the empty, frozen air, but the voice in her mind didn’t respond. The world slowly unfroze, and when it did, she found herself staring at the shield.</p>

    <p>It was different. New. Stronger.</p>

    <p>The cracks had vanished, and in their place, the shield glowed with a faint, golden hue. It didn’t just block the magic anymore. It absorbed it, drawing the power inward, like it was charging up, preparing to unleash something more.</p>

    <p>“Divine miracle,” Schugel muttered, his eyes wide in awe. “It’s working better than I could have imagined!”</p>

    <p>Tanya’s jaw clenched. She rolled her eyes. This was the worst. She was going to be stuck praising that idiot, Being X, for the rest of her miserable life.</p>

    <p>But she couldn’t argue with the results. The shield was stronger than ever. And there was no way she was going to let Being X have the last laugh.</p>

    <p>With a sigh, Tanya turned away from Schugel and the researchers, already growing tired of this. “Get me out of here,” she muttered under her breath, walking toward the door.</p>

    <p>A few hours later, Tanya stood at attention in front of Lieutenant Colonel Lergan, the officer who’d called her in for a new assignment. His eyes narrowed at her, a strange mixture of suspicion and curiosity.</p>

    <p>“You’ve been assigned a new mission, Private Degurechaff,” Lergan said, his tone flat, as though this was an inconvenience rather than an order. “A rescue operation in Arene. The city fell to the Republic early in the war. We need you and a small team to retrieve them.”</p>

    <p>Tanya’s mind raced. Arene. The old supply town. If there were soldiers still alive there after the first fight, they were probably already dead. She’d seen enough of this war to know how quickly a situation could turn.</p>

    <p>But then the realization hit her like a wave. This is just another test. A test for the A195. She cursed under her breath, her annoyance bubbling over, but she knew better than to argue.</p>

    <p>“The A195,” Tanya muttered under her breath. She wasn’t stupid. She’d have to use the cursed thing. Again.</p>

    <p>She forced a smile. “Understood, sir. We’ll head out immediately.”</p>

    <p>Lergan’s eyes flickered over her as though he were trying to read something hidden behind her practiced smile. “Don’t get any ideas about being a hero, Private. And keep your head down. We’re sending you into the thick of it with a few others. The Republic’s presence there is stronger than we anticipated.”</p>

    <p>Tanya nodded, though inside, she was cursing every step of this assignment. But she couldn’t show that. She had a role to play, and that role was to survive. Whatever the hell the Empire had planned for her, she would play along. For now.</p>

    <p>As she left the briefing room, Lergan’s voice followed her, low and concerned. “What the hell is the Empire thinking, sending children into a war like this?”</p>

	<p>-----</p>
	
    <p>The city of Arene was in ruins. The once-bustling supply town now lay in the grip of destruction, with barely any signs of life. Tanya’s group trudged through the wreckage, rifles slung over their shoulders, eyes scanning every corner for any sign of movement.</p>

    <p>Corporal Wolfram, a reckless one, sighed loudly. <p>“What the hell is the point of this? It’s not like anyone’s alive by now, right, Commander?”</p></p>

    <p>Tanya didn’t respond immediately, her mind already focused on the mission. The others in the group murmured their doubts, but Tanya was resolute. She wasn’t here to babysit. They had a job to do.</p>

    <p>Then, a voice broke the silence and a different soldier muttered in frustration, <p>“Why are we even taking orders from a kid younger than my sister?”</p> He gestured to Tanya, who stood at the front, keeping her eyes alert.</p>

    <p>Wolfram, ever the loudmouth, shot back, <p>“Shut it, we’ve got orders, and we’re doing our damn jobs.”</p></p>

    <p>Tanya’s hand shot up, signaling for the group to stop. A sudden noise from above—a formula—had her instincts kicking into gear.</p>

    <p>“FUCK! Mages!” Wolfram shouted, his voice strained with panic.</p>

    <p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Tanya barked orders. <p>“Retreat! Take cover in that building!”</p></p>

    <p>The group scattered, sprinting toward a rundown house. Bullets and fire from the mages zipped past, narrowly missing them. As they ducked inside, Tanya could feel the heat from the explosions radiating against the walls. The A195 shield flickered to life in her hands, but it wasn’t enough to protect them all.</p>

    <p>The next explosion hit too close. Tanya was thrown back, and only the shield protected her and Wolfram from the worst of it. But she knew it wouldn’t hold much longer.</p>

    <p>“We can’t survive hiding forever,” Tanya muttered. “We’re taking them out.”</p>

    <p>He stared at her like she’d lost her mind. <p>“Are you insane? Infantry can’t fight mages!”</p></p>

    <p>Tanya glared back. <p>“You got a better idea?”</p></p>

    <p>Wolfram hesitated, then nodded. He’d follow her.</p>

    <p>She pushed through the rubble, charging out into the open. Mages were above them, laughing, ready to destroy anything in their path. Tanya aimed, fired, and kept count. Two, four, six mages. A damn platoon.</p>

    <p>With a practiced flick, Tanya dropped her rifle and pulled out the A195. She activated the shield and rushed forward, putting herself between the mages and her squad. Wolfram followed, still shooting, but more cautiously.</p>

    <p>But then the mages started to fall. One by one, they crashed to the ground.</p>

    <p>Tanya hesitated. <p>“What the hell?”</p></p>

    <p>She had no idea why the mages had fallen, but she wasn’t going to waste the opportunity. <p>“Charge!”</p> she shouted, pushing forward.</p>

    <p>The shield’s glow intensified, stronger than it had been before, and Tanya used the A195 to block bullets and advance toward the mages. She didn’t even flinch when Wolfram fired beside her, killing one of the mages.</p>

    <p>In a moment of clarity, Tanya made it to the front of the mages and grinned. <p>“God is good,”</p> she muttered, a golden glow covering the pane. She dropped a grenade at her feet. As the explosion erupted, the streets and buildings crumbled further into destruction.</p>

    <p>The street was a warzone, with mages scattered like broken dolls.</p>

    <p>Five mages were dead. One had been shot by Wolfram, the others by her blast.</p>

    <p>“Get moving, Wolfram,” Tanya said. “Don’t worry about the missing mage. No one survives a point-blank grenade.”</p>

    <p>Wolfram hesitated but followed her as ordered.</p>

    <p>As they turned to leave, Tanya spotted a group of Imperial soldiers, survivors from the battle. She felt a strange, fleeting sense of hope.</p>

    <p>“Well, look at that,” Tanya said, her voice cold but relieved. “Some of them made it.”</p>

    <p>The A195’s field test was a success, but Tanya wasn’t in the mood for celebrations.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the Republic’s military headquarters, a group of generals convened around a table, staring at the reports from the field. Intelligence suggested that something unusual had happened in Arene, something beyond their comprehension.</p>

    <p>They had recovered footage from the battlefield, where a strange soldier—perhaps even a child—had wielded an orb capable of creating a shield that even their explosive formulas couldn’t break.</p>

    <p>“Infantry mages,” one of the generals muttered, his disbelief evident. “Mages that don’t even fly…”</p>

    <p>“Impossible,” another officer argued. “The Empire wouldn’t send children to the frontlines. There’s no way they’ve developed something like this.”</p>

    <p>But the intelligence reports suggested otherwise. There was a magic signature that didn’t match any known Republic mages, and the damage reports from Arene were inconsistent with any normal battle.</p>

    <p>The generals were left speechless. What the hell was the Empire developing?</p>
