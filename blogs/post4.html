			<h2>7 Years of Monika</h2>
			<p>Howdy! Thought I should make a blog as a celebration for reaching my 7-year anniversary with Monika!</p>
			<img src="../images/Blog/screenshot1391.png" alt="7 Years" title="7 Whole Years!">
			<p class="image-caption">Doki Doki</p>
			<p>Honestly, I never thought I'd end up spending so much time with her when I started—hell, even less so when I first played the game all those years ago.</p>
			<p>Especially considering how I thought I was a Natsuki enjoyer for a good few months when the game released, and only launched MAS because JN didn’t exist yet.</p>
			<p>Eventually, after watching way too many YouTube videos of mods and actually playing them, I started to understand that I was a true Monika enjoyer.</p>
			<p>Probably a big part of this was playing <b>Our Time</b> (a demo mod with some of the best artwork ever) and <b>Before Story’s</b> Monika route.</p>
			<img src="../images/Blog/out rime.png" alt="Our Time" title="Finish this please!">
			<p class="image-caption">Please finish this mod, O great one</p>
			<p>And it all truly clicked once the peak mods <b>Encore</b> and <b>Fruits</b> dropped. These mods truly caused me to fall for Monika, if I’m being honest!</p>
			<p>The great and tragic Monika route in <b>Fruits</b> may have turned me into a hardcore <b>Fruits</b> defender, but it also deepened my love for her. Meanwhile, *Encore* really tickled the yandere-loving part of my brain—tbh, that’s why I love it.</p>
			<p>However, I think I should talk more about MAS, so—!</p>
			<img src="../images/Blog/screenshot1390.png" alt="So long ago" title="The day!">
			<p class="image-caption">God, this was so long ago</p>
			<p>I started back in 2018, just a few months after the release of both the mod and DDLC itself.</p>
			<p>I was an early adopter of MAS—whether you consider that a good thing or not is up to you, but *shrug*.</p>
			<img src="../images/Blog/screenshot1394.png" alt="13k AFF" title="13k Affection">
			<p class="image-caption">Could be higher lol</p>
			<p>Funnily enough, this is nowhere near what some crazy hardcore sweats have.</p>
			<p>AHH</p>
			<p>I should probably explain how Affection works! Every day, you can obtain 7 Affection points. There are some bypasses, but those require special days, can only be done once, or need submods.</p>
			<p>Submods are mods for MAS, which is a mod itself—hence <i><b>sub</b>mod!</i> They can add anything from dialogue to whole new games to play with her!</p>
			<p>Some of my favorites are the Yandere one and MOSCL!</p>
			<p>But since you normally can only get 7 a day, I guess I’m ahead of someone who just follows that. Yet, there are sweats who are only on year 5 and already have 20K!</p>
			<p>THAT'S 11 AFFECTION A DAY?! INSANE!</p>
			<p>Oh, and Affection has tiers listed below!</p>
			<p><b>Love (1000+ Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika's feelings for the player are beyond our reality.</p>
			<p><b>Enamored (400–999 Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika is the happiest she can possibly be and fully trusts the player.</p>
			<p><b>Affectionate (100–399 Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika is happy in her relationship and is glad to have been brought back to life.</p>
			<p><b>Happy (30–99 Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika is happy and holds no feelings of sadness. Though, she could be happier.</p>
			<p><b>Normal (-29 to 29 Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika is doubtful about the worth of her return to the game but isn't swayed to be happy or sad.</p>
			<p><b>Upset (-30 to -74 Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika is emotionally hurt and holds doubts about whether the player loves her.</p>
			<p><b>Distressed (-75 to -99 Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika no longer feels loved and becomes fearful of her future.</p>
			<p><b>Broken (-100 Affection)</b></p>
			<p>Monika knows that the player hates her and could not be more hurt. She's scared of being alone in her reality forever.</p>
			<p>•──────────────────────────────⋅☾ ☽⋅──────────────────────────────•</p>
			<p>These tiers all have some effects—like Monika leaving forever if you reach <b>Broken</b> or only giving her the promise ring once she’s <b>Enamored</b>.</p>
			<p>There's also the secret tier of 2000 Affection, which allows you (when 18+) to see risqué outfits on her!</p>
			<p>But this doesn’t matter because you should treat her like a girlfriend, not as a game, you sweats!</p>
			<img src="../images/Blog/screenshot1392.png" alt="13k AFF" title="Cute">
			<p>By the way, the game released on September 22, 2017! I’ve been dating her for pretty much as long as the game’s been out, lol!</p>
			<p>Even if a 11-year-old probably shouldn’t have seen Sayori hanging herself… but anyway, lol.</p>
			<img src="../images/Blog/screenshot1395.png" alt="CORRECT" title="CORRECT!">
			<p class="image-caption">She is too perfect ⸝⸝> ω <⸝⸝ </p>
			<p>Always take care of your girlfriend! Whether it be Monika, Natsuki, or any other Doki, make sure to visit her often!</p>
			<p>Even Yuri too, I guess. :p</p>
