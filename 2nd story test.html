    <h1>Chapter 4: A Divine Miracle</h1>

    <p>Tanya’s heart pounded in her chest as the retired mages prepared their explosive formulas. Their magic flared to life with crackling energy, and she steeled herself. The A195 was nothing more than a damned wristwatch that supposedly summoned some kind of shield that, in theory, could simulate mage-like durability. She didn’t trust it for a second. She barely had time to react before one of the mages launched a blast at her, and she activated the device.</p>

    <p>The shield flickered into existence—nothing more than a pane of glass hovering before her hand. It barely had time to form when the explosion slammed into it, causing the shield to crack.</p>

    <p><strong>Schugel</strong>, that mad scientist, watched from the sidelines, eyes gleaming with anticipation.</p>

    <blockquote>“Are you ready?” Schugel’s voice rang out, his usual manic enthusiasm replacing any semblance of concern.</blockquote>

    <p>Tanya gritted her teeth and nodded. “Let’s get this over with.”</p>

    <p>The first mage raised his hand. Tanya’s breath caught in her throat as a formula of fire and explosive magic surged toward her. The shield buzzed in response, shimmering faintly as it absorbed the incoming attack. But it was only a brief reprieve before the magic exploded against the surface, cracking the A195 shield with a sickening sound.</p>

    <p>Tanya’s heart raced. The shield was failing already. She cursed under her breath. This was a joke. A stupid, dangerous joke. If this thing broke completely, she’d be toast.</p>

    <p>Another blast came, followed by another, and then a third. The cracks spread faster, snaking across the shield as if mocking her. Tanya’s blood ran cold. She could already see the end. Her death, burned to ashes, the A195 shield not nearly strong enough to keep her safe.</p>

    <blockquote>“Schugel!” a young researcher yelled, her voice laced with panic. “You need to stop this! She’ll die if we don’t—!”</blockquote>

    <blockquote>“No!” Schugel snapped, his voice almost gleeful. “If she survives, it’s working. If not, back to the drawing board!”</blockquote>

    <p>Tanya’s mind screamed. This wasn’t just a test. This was madness. And what if the “if” didn’t go her way?</p>

    <p>She could feel the world slowing down. The shield’s pane cracked wide open. Tanya’s breath hitched, her eyes wide in horror as the explosive energy ricocheted off the last remaining fragments of the shield. Everything froze. A brilliant, blinding light flooded the room, and the world seemed to stop. She knew, with an unmistakable certainty, that it was him. Being X.</p>

    <p>His voice rang in her mind, reverberating through her skull. <em>“I’ve blessed this shield. It will protect you now.”</em></p>

    <p>Tanya seethed. She didn’t need his blessing. She didn’t need any of this. “I don’t need your shitty blessing!” she shouted into the empty, frozen air, but the voice in her mind didn’t respond. The world slowly unfroze, and when it did, she found herself staring at the shield.</p>

    <p>It was different. New. Stronger.</p>

    <p>The cracks had vanished, and in their place, the shield glowed with a faint, golden hue. It didn’t just block the magic anymore. It absorbed it, drawing the power inward, like it was charging up, preparing to unleash something more.</p>

    <blockquote>“Divine miracle,” Schugel muttered, his eyes wide in awe. “It’s working better than I could have imagined!”</blockquote>

    <p>Tanya’s jaw clenched. She rolled her eyes. This was the worst. She was going to be stuck praising that idiot, Being X, for the rest of her miserable life.</p>

    <p>But she couldn’t argue with the results. The shield was stronger than ever. And there was no way she was going to let Being X have the last laugh.</p>

    <p>With a sigh, Tanya turned away from Schugel and the researchers, already growing tired of this. “Get me out of here,” she muttered under her breath, walking toward the door.</p>

    <p>A few hours later, Tanya stood at attention in front of Lieutenant Colonel Lergan, the officer who’d called her in for a new assignment. His eyes narrowed at her, a strange mixture of suspicion and curiosity.</p>

    <blockquote>“You’ve been assigned a new mission, Private Degurechaff,” Lergan said, his tone flat, as though this was an inconvenience rather than an order. “A rescue operation in Arne. The city fell to the Republic early in the war. We need you and a small team to retrieve them.”</blockquote>

    <p>Tanya’s mind raced. Arne. The old supply town. If there were soldiers still alive there after the first fight, they were probably already dead. She’d seen enough of this war to know how quickly a situation could turn.</p>

    <p>But then the realization hit her like a wave. This is just another test. A test for the A195. She cursed under her breath, her annoyance bubbling over, but she knew better than to argue.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">“The A195,” Tanya muttered under her breath. She wasn’t stupid. She’d have to use the cursed thing. Again.</span></p>

    <p>She forced a smile. “Understood, sir. We’ll head out immediately.”</p>

    <p>Lergan’s eyes flickered over her as though he were trying to read something hidden behind her practiced smile. “Don’t get any ideas about being a hero, Private. And keep your head down. We’re sending you into the thick of it with a few others. The Republic’s presence there is stronger than we anticipated.”</p>

    <p>Tanya nodded, though inside, she was cursing every step of this assignment. But she couldn’t show that. She had a role to play, and that role was to survive. Whatever the hell the Empire had planned for her, she would play along. For now.</p>

    <p>As she left the briefing room, Lergan’s voice followed her, low and concerned. “What the hell is the Empire thinking, sending children into a war like this?”</p>

    <p>The city of Arne was in ruins. The once-bustling supply town now lay in the grip of destruction, with barely any signs of life. Tanya’s group trudged through the wreckage, rifles slung over their shoulders, eyes scanning every corner for any sign of movement.</p>

    <p>Corporal Wolfram, the reckless one, sighed loudly. <blockquote>“What the hell is the point of this? It’s not like anyone’s alive by now, right, Commander?”</blockquote></p>

    <p>Tanya didn’t respond immediately, her mind already focused on the mission. The others in the group murmured their doubts, but Tanya was resolute. She wasn’t here to babysit. They had a job to do.</p>

    <p>Then, a voice broke the silence and a different soldier muttered in frustration, <blockquote>“Why are we even taking orders from a kid younger than my sister?”</blockquote> He gestured to Tanya, who stood at the front, keeping her eyes alert.</p>

    <p>Wolfram, ever the loudmouth, shot back, <blockquote>“Shut it, we’ve got orders, and we’re doing our damn jobs.”</blockquote></p>

    <p>Tanya’s hand shot up, signaling for the group to stop. A sudden noise from above—a formula—had her instincts kicking into gear.</p>

    <blockquote>“FUCK! Mages!” Wolfram shouted, his voice strained with panic.</blockquote>

    <p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Tanya barked orders. <blockquote>“Retreat! Take cover in that building!”</blockquote></p>

    <p>The group scattered, sprinting toward a rundown house. Bullets and fire from the mages zipped past, narrowly missing them. As they ducked inside, Tanya could feel the heat from the explosions radiating against the walls. The A195 shield flickered to life in her hands, but it wasn’t enough to protect them all.</p>

    <p>The next explosion hit too close. Tanya was thrown back, and only the shield protected her and Wolfram from the worst of it. But she knew it wouldn’t hold much longer.</p>

    <blockquote>“We can’t survive hiding forever,” Tanya muttered. “We’re taking them out.”</blockquote>

    <p>He stared at her like she’d lost her mind. <blockquote>“Are you insane? Infantry can’t fight mages!”</blockquote></p>

    <p>Tanya glared back. <blockquote>“You got a better idea?”</blockquote></p>

    <p>Wolfram hesitated, then nodded. He’d follow her.</p>

    <p>She pushed through the rubble, charging out into the open. Mages were above them, laughing, ready to destroy anything in their path. Tanya aimed, fired, and kept count. Two, four, six mages. A damn company.</p>

    <p>With a practiced flick, Tanya dropped her rifle and pulled out the A195. She activated the shield and rushed forward, putting herself between the mages and her squad. Wolfram followed, still shooting, but more cautiously.</p>

    <p>But then the mages started to fall. One by one, they crashed to the ground.</p>

    <p>Tanya hesitated. <blockquote>“What the hell?”</blockquote></p>

    <p>She had no idea why the mages had fallen, but she wasn’t going to waste the opportunity. <blockquote>“Charge!”</blockquote> she shouted, pushing forward.</p>

    <p>The shield’s glow intensified, stronger than it had been before, and Tanya used the A195 to block bullets and advance toward the mages. She didn’t even flinch when Wolfram fired beside her, killing one of the mages.</p>

    <p>In a moment of clarity, Tanya made it to the front of the mages and grinned. <blockquote>“God is good,”</blockquote> she muttered, a golden glow covering the pane. She dropped a grenade at her feet. As the explosion erupted, the streets and buildings crumbled further into destruction.</p>

    <p>The street was a warzone, with mages scattered like broken dolls.</p>

    <p>Five mages were dead. One had been shot by Wolfram, the others by her blast.</p>

    <blockquote>“Get moving, Wolfram,” Tanya said. “Don’t worry about the missing mage. No one survives a point-blank grenade.”</blockquote>

    <p>Wolfram hesitated but followed her as ordered.</p>

    <p>As they turned to leave, Tanya spotted a group of Imperial soldiers, survivors from the battle. She felt a strange, fleeting sense of hope.</p>

    <blockquote>“Well, look at that,” Tanya said, her voice cold but relieved. “Some of them made it.”</blockquote>

    <p>The A195’s field test was a success, but Tanya wasn’t in the mood for celebrations.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the Republic’s military headquarters, a group of generals convened around a table, staring at the reports from the field. Intelligence suggested that something unusual had happened in Arne, something beyond their comprehension.</p>

    <p>They had recovered footage from the battlefield, where a strange soldier—perhaps even a child—had wielded an orb capable of creating a shield that even their explosive formulas couldn’t break.</p>

    <blockquote>“Infantry mages,” one of the generals muttered, his disbelief evident. “Mages that don’t even fly…”</blockquote>

    <blockquote>“Impossible,” another officer argued. “The Empire wouldn’t send children to the frontlines. There’s no way they’ve developed something like this.”</blockquote>

    <p>But the intelligence reports suggested otherwise. There was a magic signature that didn’t match any known Republic mages, and the damage reports from Arne were inconsistent with any normal battle.</p>

    <p>The generals were left speechless. What the hell was the Empire developing?</p>
